                    <aside>
                    <p>I am an <i>aspiring</i> <span style="color:navy">Software Engineer</span> with interests in Mathematics, Software Engineering, Algorithms, Data Science, and Machine Learning. I am a current fourth year at University of California San Diego majoring in Mathematics - Computer Science.
                    One of the most <em>interesting</em> concepts Iâ€™ve encountered during my undergraduate study is Discrete Mathematics & Graph Theory. Having came from a strong mathematical background, it was eye-opening to see mathematical concepts applied in various algorithms, such as DFS, and theories that have great importance and applications to Computer Science. 
                    I also place heavy importance on the mathematical value of Python using Scipy or Pandas and many other computing packages which are crucial to computing Linear Algebraic problems and much more. I hope to explore to the full extent of what can be achieved using Python, whether it be extensive numerical analysis using algorithms or the implementation of neural nets.
                    Ultimately, having both a background in Mathematics and Computer Science, I hope to supplement my future studies and work in the Computer Science field using my skills in Mathematics as a foundation.
